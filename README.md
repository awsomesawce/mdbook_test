# MD Book for Bash/Zsh Shell Notes

## Why?

This repo was originally for testing [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) which is a great tool for creating a full site from just a few **Markdown** files.

`mdbook` is fast, but it doesn't include some of the extra _syntax_ that `kramdown` supports.

`mdbook` is a `rust` program.  It can be installed easily on _Windows_ or _Unix_-based machines.

## Subjects

- `bash` syntax.
- `zsh` syntax.
- Difference between `bash`/`zsh` and `powershell` syntax.

I'm documenting when there is overlap with shell builtins and external commands.  For instance, in Linux there is both an `echo` external command and `echo` bash builtin.
Also documenting the difference between **Zsh's** `print` and the `printf` external command.  **Zsh** can emulate `printf` by using `print -f`.  **Zsh's** `print` is like an enhanced version of **Bash's** `echo`.
