# MD Book test

This
is
a
test.

## Why?

This repo is a test.  I'm testing the `rust` program `mdbook` and it's capabilities compared to `gitbook`.
This book will cover a wide variety of subjects involving Bash, WSL, and other programs and programming stuff.

`mdbook` is fast, but it doesn't include some of the extra _syntax_ that `kramdown` supports.

`kramdown` is a **RubyGem** that implements a _superset_ of **Markdown**.
