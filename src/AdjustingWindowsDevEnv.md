# Adjusting Windows Development Environment

**Windows** is a nice Operating System, and it has kept getting better despite
people not beliving in it's full potential.

## Windows 11

Windows _11_ is out right now.  I am able to upgrade to _Windows 11_ right
now if I wanted to.
The problem is that I lose a few things when doing that.
But I also _gain things_.
Windows 11 is the only build of _Windows_ that receives updates regarding _WSL_ and _other technologies_.
I'm not sure how much the upgrade will cost but I'm _assumming_ that it's _free_... just like the 
other upgrades to the system.
A lot of people are _afraid_ of change because something might change that they do not _agree with_.
