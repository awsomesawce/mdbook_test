# Markdown Renderers

Markdown renderers come in many different shapes and sizes.  
There has been an attempt to standardize the language by introducing the **CommonMark** specification.
This is a good thing since so many people rely on **Markdown** syntax to write their site content or books or journal entries or just plain notes!

This is what makes **Markdown** so special.  It has so many uses.
The implementations differ slightly, but you can expect a certain set of features to be present in _all_ implementations. These features include:

- **Bold**, _italics_, and `code` syntax.
- Lists
  - Embedded lists
  - One
  - Two
