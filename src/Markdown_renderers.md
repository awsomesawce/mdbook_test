# Markdown Renderers

Markdown renderers come in many different shapes and sizes.  
There has been an attempt to standardize the language by introducing the **CommonMark** specification.
This is a good thing since so many people rely on **Markdown** syntax to write their site content or books or journal entries or just plain notes!

This is what makes **Markdown** so special.  It has so many uses.
The implementations differ slightly, but you can expect a certain set of features to be present in _all_ implementations. These features include:

## List of markdown renderers

Here shall be a list of all types of `markdown` processors, converters, and renderers.

- [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it): an npm package that enables smart converting of markdown to html.  Comes with cli and api.

> There is a python version of `markdown-it` [here](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-it-py/) with it's docs [here](https://markdown-it-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

- `kramdown`: a _Rubygem_ that is essentially a _superset_ of markdown.
- `mdbook`: a _gitbook_-like program written in `rust`.

> `mdbook` is more than just a markdown parser and renderer.
> It's more like a documentation generator and simple static-site-generator.

- `markdownlint`: an npm package that enables linting of markdown documents.
- `markdown_py`: a _python_ version of the original `markdown` program written in C.
- `discount`: Old markdown renderer written in C
