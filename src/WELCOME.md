# Welcome to my MDBook test

_There be docs here!_

This `mdbook` is just a collection of notes and posts about subjects like _shell programming_ and other programming
with various languages.

- _Powershell_
- _Python_
- _Nodejs_

Mainly I've been concentrating on mostly _interpreted_ languages, **NodeJs** mostly.
