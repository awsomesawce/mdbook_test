# Chapter 2

This is chapter 2 of my `mdbook`.  I'm excited to really start using this program and find out what it can do.  This program is capable of a lot of things and I've barely scratched the surface.
After all, it's written in pure **Rust** language.  **Rust** is known to be a very secure and performant language right up there with **C**.  
In fact, it's reference implementation is written in **C**, just like **Python**, except **Rust** is more **C**-like than **Python**.

## Experimenting with Emacs linux GUI

So on **Windows** I don't get to be able to just _open a terminal_ on **Emacs** without jumping thru a few hoops.  I'm sure I could do it for **Powershell** just fine, but I haven't found a good way to open a WSL linux shell in an Emacs buffer.

Well now I can!

_Introducing the Emacs Linux GUI!_.  I'm now able to open a terminal emulator buffer by using the command `M-x ansi-term` in another buffer/window.

This allows me to embed the command shell in the program I'm using _(Emacs)_.

This has already been possible with **Neovim**, but having 

## Installing new software

Installing new software on **Arch Linux** is pretty straightforward.  If I run into a `404` error when trying to install a package, I just run `sudo pacman -Syu` which updates my system and updates the mirror list.

The reason this has to be done so often is because o

I just installed `kgpg`, `kget`, `dolphin` (file browser), and `kde-cli-tools`.

Now I'm installing some **KDE** applications.

## Problems with graphical software

I need to troubleshoot some things.  I guess I'm missing some dependencies for some things because I keep getting error messages about certain pieces of software.

I run into errors with `dconf` all the time.
