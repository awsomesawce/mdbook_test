# Chapter 1

Hello and _welcome_ to my first test of the **Rust** program called `mdbook`.

This is essentially a program that enables a writer to use the free markup language **Markdown** build and render 
a book.  
In order to create a book from `markdown` files, a few things need to be in order first.

- Summary page: This page gives a summary of what's going on in the book.
- Chapter pages.
- `mdbook init` inside an empty repository to initialize the mdbook.

## More info

More info will be written into [Markdown_renderers.md](./Markdown_renderers.md)
