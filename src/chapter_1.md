# Chapter 1

Hello and _welcome_ to my first test of the **Rust** program called `mdbook`.

This is essentially a program that enables a writer to use the free markup language **Markdown** build and render 
a book.  
In order to create a book from `markdown` files, a few things need to be in order first.

- Summary page: This page gives a summary of what's going on in the book.
- Chapter pages.
- `mdbook init` inside an empty repository to initialize the mdbook.

## Markdown renderers

Here shall be a list of all types of `markdown` processors, converters, and renderers.

- `markdown-it`: an npm package that enables smart converting of markdown to html.
- `kramdown`: a _Rubygem_ that is essentially a _superset_ of markdown.
- `mdbook`: a _gitbook_-like program written in `rust`.

> `mdbook` is more than just a markdown parser and renderer.
> It's more like a documentation generator and simple static-site-generator.

- `markdownlint`: an npm package that enables linting of markdown documents.
- `markdown_py`: a _python_ version of the original `markdown` program written in C.

## More info

More info will be written into [Markdown_renderers.md](./Markdown_renderers.md)
